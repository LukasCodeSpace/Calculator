# Calculator(Qt & C++)
A desktop calculator built using C++ and Qt Widgets.
The application replicates the basic functionality of the Windows calculator and was developed to practice GUI development and event-driven programming with Qt.

This project focuses on building a structured Qt application while keeping the code readable and maintainable.
