This is my first project with C++ and QT.
The calculator is working very similar to the windows calculator.
It has two displays, the upper one for showing the whole calculation and the lower one for showing the result.
As well as PushButtons for number and operator input.

Current problems are:
It is not possible to display multiple root symbols e.g.: √5 + √5.
Operator precedence is not working yet e.g.: 5^2 + 5^2 doesn't calculate properly.

Further developement:
I'm going to rewrite the whole calculation function in a way that solve the problems I mentioned above.
After that the calculator should also function as an equation solver.
