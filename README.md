This is my first project with C++ and the QT framework.
The calculator works similar to the windows calculator.

Functions:
Upper display: Shows full equation
Lower display: Shows the result
PushButtons: Number and operator input

Current problems:
Operator precedence not yet implemented
It is not possible to display multiple root symbols in the upper display

Development goals:
Rewrite the whole calculator function to support operator precedence
Transform calculator into equations solver
